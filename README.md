SQUARE CODE ENCODER

The Square Code Encoder project is designed to encode a given input text using a classic encryption method that rearranges the characters in a square matrix format and reads them vertically. This encoding is a simple yet effective way of scrambling messages, making them less readable without reversing the process. The encoder normalizes the input by removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting the text to lowercase. It then calculates the smallest possible square or rectangle dimensions required for encoding and reads the message column-wise to produce the output.
